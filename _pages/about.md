I am a 3rd Year PhD student in Economics in University of Warwick. I am interested in the intersection of platform design and applied microeconomics, using large and novel data-sets to understand behaviour online. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions. I am a [CAGE](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/centres/cage/) Junior fellow.
