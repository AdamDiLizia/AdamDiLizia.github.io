**Social Influence in Online Reviews: Evidence from the Steam Store** ([Latest Version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mNdICciRkF9q2o8r6_p1dtpR-VGxMTHE/view)) ([Working Paper](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/centres/cage/manage/publications/wp714.2024.pdf))
  * Winner of the Best Paper award of the Business and Industry Section of the Royal Statistical Society at NIE Conference 2024
  * Presented at CODE @ MIT 2024, RES 2025

How does social influence affect consumer ratings? Using a dataset from the
popular Steam gaming platform I investigate how quality judgements depend
on pre-existing consumer assessments. In 2019, Steam introduced a new review
system which decreased the exposure of users to previous ratings. Firstly, I
find that user ratings are dependent on average ratings. The result is not due
to selection, and is robust to a range of alternative specifications. Secondly,
the effect is heavily asymmetric: individual reviewers are more negative when
exposed to a lower average rating, but do not respond to a higher one. I
rationalize these results with a model of reviewer behavior. Finally, using owner
data, I estimate a structural model of game choice. A 1% increase in rating is
equivalent to a 2 dollar price reduction. This suggests social influence has large
implications for buyers and sellers.


**Can Hate Speech Be Banned Online? The Effects of Shutting Down Toxic Forums on Reddit** *with Lily Shevchenko* ([Latest Version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I7bACt9uA_6ayOM3-_UhMi1aLHRJFmeO/view?usp=sharing)) ([Working Paper](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/centres/cage/manage/publications/wp790.2026.pdf))

Is deplatforming effective in reducing toxicity on social media? To answer this
question we study a policy change on Reddit in June 2020 which led to a simultaneous
ban of thousands of forums containing hateful content, but not the users of these
forums. We use data on the near universe of comments left on Reddit to examine
the impact of the ban on user behaviour in a differences-in-differences design. We
find that the most active users of banned subreddits comment more after the policy
change and substitute to new forums in the weeks after the ban. The increase in
activity persists in the long run, but is not associated with higher toxicity: instead,
the comments left by affected users outside banned subreddits contain 20% fewer
instances of hate speech. We do not find evidence that the policy leads to lower
quality of engagement, negative spillover effects or recreation of banned subreddits
elsewhere on the platform. Overall, the results suggest that moderation targeting
toxic digital spaces can be effective in combating hate speech without lowering user
engagement, and thus can be aligned with platforms’ incentives.

**Atomic Attention on YouTube: "Brainrot" and Short-form Content** Link Coming Soon!

Has the rise of short-form content worsened our attention spans? Using the
staggered rollout of YouTube Shorts across markets and channels, alongside rich
video-level data including transcripts and attention heatmaps from 14 popular US media channels, I find that the introduction of short-form content significantly
worsens user attention to their usual videos. Skipping to a given video slice in-
creases by approximately 30% relative to the pre-Shorts mean, with across-video
comparisons showing that longer videos are worst affected. Within-video analysis
reveals that users disproportionately skip toward the beginning of videos, but not
the end, suggesting this worsening attention has implications for information acqui-
sition. The effect is sustained over time and robust to controlling flexibly for views
and video content. These
findings provide empirical evidence of attention externalities across news media from
short-form content exposure.
