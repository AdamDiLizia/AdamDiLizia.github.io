**Social Influence in Online Reviews: Evidence from the Steam Store** ([Latest Version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mNdICciRkF9q2o8r6_p1dtpR-VGxMTHE/view)) ([WP link](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/economics/research/centres/cage/manage/publications/wp714.2024.pdf))

How does social influence affect consumer ratings? Using a dataset from the
popular Steam gaming platform I investigate how quality judgements depend
on pre-existing consumer assessments. In 2019, Steam introduced a new review
system which decreased the exposure of users to previous ratings. Firstly, I
find that user ratings are dependent on average ratings. The result is not due
to selection, and is robust to a range of alternative specifications. Secondly,
the effect is heavily asymmetric: individual reviewers are more negative when
exposed to a lower average rating, but do not respond to a higher one. I
rationalize these results with a model of reviewer behavior. Finally, using owner
data, I estimate a structural model of game choice. A 1% increase in rating is
equivalent to a 2 dollar price reduction. This suggests social influence has large
implications for buyers and sellers.


**Can Hate Speech be Banned Online? Evidence from Reddit** *with Lily Shevchenko*

Is deplatforming effective in reducing toxicity on social media? To answer this
question we study a policy change on Reddit in June 2020 which led to a simultaneous
ban of thousands of forums containing hateful content, but not the users of these
forums. We use data on the near universe of comments left on Reddit to examine
the impact of the ban on user behaviour in a differences-in-differences design. We
find that the most active users of banned subreddits comment more after the policy
change and substitute to new forums in the weeks after the ban. The increase in
activity persists in the long run, but is not associated with higher toxicity: instead,
the comments left by affected users outside banned subreddits contain 20% fewer
instances of hate speech. We do not find evidence that the policy leads to lower
quality of engagement, negative spillover effects or recreation of banned subreddits
elsewhere on the platform. Overall, the results suggest that moderation targeting
toxic digital spaces can be effective in combating hate speech without lowering user
engagement, and thus can be aligned with platforms’ incentives.
